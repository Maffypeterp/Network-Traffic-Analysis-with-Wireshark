# Network-Traffic-Analysis-with-Wireshark

Network traffic analysis involves monitoring and examining data packets that flow through a network to understand its behavior, identify issues, and enhance security. Wireshark is a powerful and free tool used for this purpose.

## Objective

Network traffic analysis project aimed to capture and analyze real-time network traffic using Wireshark. Identify and interpret common network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS). Recognize abnormal or suspicious traffic patterns indicating potential security threats. To enhance understanding of packet-level communication and network behavior.


### Skills Learned

-  Skilled in live monitoring and quick interpretation of network traffic..
-  Ability to identify and resolve network issues such as delays and connectivity failures.
-  Improved ability to spot unusual or malicious traffic behavior
-  Built experience in analyzing traffic in various environments (LAN, wireless, virtual networks).
-  Proficient in Wiresharkâ€™s features such as filters, color rules, and statistics panels.


### Tools Used

*** First Packet Capture:2025-07-21 23:52:30

*** Last  Packet Capture:2025-07-21 23:55:38

*** Network Interface used: Eth0

### Steps

Below are the key steps taken in the Packet Capturing and Analysis process:

### 1. Start capturing:

Click on network interface to start capturing traffic. You will see packets being listed in real-time

1.1 Generate traffic:
To see some traffic, open a web browser and visit a websites. This will generate HTTP/HTTPS traffic that Wireshark will capture

1.2 Stop Capture:
Click the red button to stop the capture after you have collected enough data.

### 2. Analyze Network Traffic

2.1 View Packet Details:
Click on a packet in the captured traffic list to view its details. The details pane below will show the packets headers and payload.

2.2 Filter Traffic:
Use display filters to focus on specific types. Enter a filter expressions such as http, tcp, ip.addr == 10.0.2.15, tcp.port == 80 in a filter bar and press Enter.

2.3 Follow TCP/UDP Streams:
Right-click on a packet and select 'Follow'-> 'TCP Stream' or 'UDP Stream' to see the entire conversation.

2.4 Inspect Packet Contents:
Expand the packet details to inspect the headers and payload of each layer(Ethernet,IP,TCP,HTTP,etc).

2.5 Create Custom Filters:
To create custom filters using Wireshark filtering language. Combine expressions to narrow down the traffic you are interested in.

### 3. Reporting

Finally, all findings were documented, including detailed description of capturing network traffic
